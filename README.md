# TMRCA
Time to most-recent common ancestor calculations

This project provides the basic code needed to perform TMRCA estimates according to the procedures used in McDonald (submitted, Genes). The file "examples.py" includes the code for generating the three basic examples in the paper. The file "example4.py" contains more specific code for the Royal Stewart household, as an example of how this can be applied to real data. The code does not extend as far as analysing the raw data itself (e.g., for determining coverage or numbers of novel variants, or creating a haplotree out of existing data) - that is left as an exercise for the user!
